    <h2>
        <strong>Directions</strong></h2>
    <ol>

    <li> Heat milk in a small saucepan until just hot to touch or a few bubbles form around the edge. Remove from heat and stir in margarine until melted; set aside.</li>

    <li>Combine 2 1/4 cups flour, white sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add milk mixture, water, and egg; beat well. Add remaining 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition.</li>

    <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>

    <li>While dough is resting, mix together brown sugar, margarine, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin pan.</li>

    <li>Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface into a 12x9-inch rectangle. Spread brown sugar mixture over dough; sprinkle with raisins.</li>

    <li>Roll up dough and pinch seam to seal. Cut into 12 equal rolls.</li>

    <li>Place cut-side up in the prepared muffin cups. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.</li>

    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 20 minutes. Remove rolls from muffin cups to cool on a wire rack. Serve warm. </li>
