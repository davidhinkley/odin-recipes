    <h2>
        Ingredients
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <strong>Sauce:</strong>

    <li>1/4 cup chicken broth</li>

    <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>

    <li>2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>

    <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>

    <strong>Stir-Fry:</strong>

    <li>pound boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>

    <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>

        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>

                    <li>1 pound asparagus, trimmed and cut into bite-sized pieces</li>

                        <li>1 white onion, cut into 1/4-inch wedges</li>

                            <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red chile, or to taste (optional)</li>

                                <li>1 lemon, thinly sliced (optional)</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>
        <strong>Directions</strong></h2>
    <ol>

    <li>chicken broth, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, lemon zest, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch together in a bowl; set aside.</li>

    <li>Mix chicken, 1/4 cup cornstarch, salt, and black pepper in a bowl and toss to coat evenly.</li>

    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook asparagus and onion until tender-crisp, stirring frequently, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove vegetables from pan; set aside.</li>

    <li>Heat remaining oil in same wok over medium-high heat and cook chicken for 3 minutes undisturbed, taking care not to overcrowd the pan. You may need to do two batches. Flip chicken over and continue cooking, breaking up any large pieces, until evenly browned, 3 to 4 minutes more.</li>

    <li>Add asparagus and onion back to the pan. Whisk sauce and pour into the pan, scraping up any browned bits. Stir constantly until sauce comes to a simmer and thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season with salt and ground black pepper. Garnish with crushed red chilies and lemon slices. </li>
